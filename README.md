# Inferring Graph Signal for Network Science

#### Abstract 
This project will work on a water leakage detection problem. Specifically, based on the BattLeDIM dataset [https://battledim.ucy.ac.cy/?page_id=33], where the readings of 33 pressure sensors (along with the readings of some other sensors) are provided to detect and localize leakages in a water distribution network. The aim of the project is to develop novel dynamic graph neural networks to exploit both spatial and temporal information to facilitate the detection of water leakages.

## Prerequisites
Explain the prerequisites for the installation here, such as the OS, or whether the program requires a GPU.
This is **not** a place to add python (or language) requirements, please see the [install guide](#install-guide) below.
An example is below:
* Ubuntu Linux > 16.04
* Anaconda python > 3.0.5
* Pytorch 1.12.0 Linux CUDA 11.6

## Install guide
Make sure that your environment is reproducible.
You can use a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-file-manually) to specify the python version and the [pip requirements](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35245610/6655465).

```sh
conda install environment.yml
```

## Experiments
It can be useful to pack experiments into python modules.
Add the code required to run a specific experiment - an example is shown below.
```sh
python experiments/the-imitation-game.py
```

## Contacts
